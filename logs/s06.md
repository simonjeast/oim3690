# Learning Log - Session 6
- In today's class I learned the basics of HTML by beginning to write my own HTML code manually, without the help of AI. I learned the standard HTML tags, like beginning every HTML file with *HTML:5* as best practice. Additionally, I learned the basic tags, like 'H1' for headers, 'P' for paragraphs, 'href' to reference another link, 'img' to reference a local image file, etc. I learned that some tags have attributes, which is extra information inside the opening tag. For example, 'img' has 'alt' imbedded within the tag which is used to provide a description of the image. I learned how to further modify an image on my basic webpage by changing its width and height, and am starting to see the basic structure of webpages. I hope to further review my AI generated index.html in order to further understand HTML, CSS, and Javascript, the three fundamental languages for web development.
