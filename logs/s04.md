# Learning Log - Session 4
- In class session four we covered some of the basics of HTML, like learning how resizing web pages (looking at them how they would appear on a mobile device vs a full size window) matters when determining the design of the web page. One way to incorporate good design practices is to fold buttons into a "burger" to condense them. Additionally, I learned about the importance of creating a web page that is surfaceable. Understanding good design choices, and how to implement them, is key for creating a good web page. I defined a web site in class as a directory of information, which I think is a suitable purpose. I also learned about tags in HTML, and what some of their purposes are, such as headers, and subheaders.
