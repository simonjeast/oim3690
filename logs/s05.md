# Learning Log - Session 5
- In today's class I learned and reinforced my learning across various topics within web development. I reinforced my learning about the difference between GET and POST, and where each is commonly used. Most websites use GET, but when you're requesting sensitive data, like putting in your username/password into Amazon, it's best practice to use POST. GET retrieves data, while POST sends data. Additionally, I learned some common terminal commands to retrieve information, like 'ping', 'tracert', 'ipconfig', etc. I learned more about the devtools section of websites, specifically that elements show HTML structure & CSS styles, the console shows javascript errors & output, network shows HTTP requests & responses, and sources shows all the code files.
