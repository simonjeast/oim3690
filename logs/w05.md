# Learning Log - Week 5
- In today's class I learned more CSS, like how to change the color of in-line text using a class selector. Some of the basic selectors are:

Basic selectors:
Element: Targets all elements of type (p.{})
Class: Targets elements with class (.intro {})
ID: Targets element with ID (#header {})
Universal: Targets all elements (* {})

- We can set a universal font, called a font-family by using the universal selector to change the font for the entire webpage.
- We can use Google Fonts to find any font you would want, google fonts comes with the embedded code to copy paste into your code for an easy patch in
- Adding borders to the webpage is an easy way to outline the design of the page. Changing the borders can be done by editing the margin of the page (margin: 0 pixels)
- Every element is a box:
Content: The actual content
Padding: space inside the border
Border: the edge
Margin: space outside the border

- Class can be used on multiple elements, while ID is unique, it can only be used once per page
- I also learned you can combine selectors to further differentiate
