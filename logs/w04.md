# Learning Log - Week 4
- In this weeks classes I continued my education about web development and it's core principles. For example, I learned more HTML tags after consulting the official Mozilla HTML dev pages, learning about semantic HTML tags, (ex: divs) and how different tags work in tandem to outline order for my web page. From there, I learned how to style my basic web page with CSS. I learned how to change the color of divs, paragraphs, headers, etc and how CSS fits in with HTML to create modern web pages. I am interested in learning Javascript next to finish my web dev stack knowledge. I found that using AI to provide some starter CSS for my about-me page and working backwards to understand the syntax was incredibly helpful, being able to ask AI any question I had along the way. With CSS, being able to change the color, font, font size, and more really adds a whole new level of style-ability to web pages, and I will be consulting the CSS dev pages to learn more about it's capabilities. One thing I found pretty interesting was the way CSS handles multiple conflicting styles. First it prioritizes inline styles, then external stylesheets, and finally browser defaults. This tells me that selecting specific styles is very important.
