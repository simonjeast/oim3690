# Learning Log - Session 2 (1/22)
- Today's class was just a review from OIM3640 for me on the basics of github - I felt like I remembered everything and had no trouble setting up the two repositories. I had ChatGPT make me a template for my github.io website - which I plan on further refining. I am looking forward to further classes and starting to learn more HTML/CSS.
